Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 6 - Make Effective Data Visualization

## Summary
In this visualization, I would like to discover if there is any relationship between the height of baseball players and their batting average. The dataset contains 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.

## Design
In the beginning, I decided to use bar charts with "height (in inches)" on the x-axis and "batting average" on the y-axis. I used only one color for the bars because I would like to avoid distraction from the colors. For each bar, I grouped up the data with the same height and calculated the average of the batting average in the group to represent the height of the bar. The graph shows that the batting average peaks at height of 67 inches and then slowly decreases as the height increases, except that there is a small jump at height of 79 inches.

After getting the first feedback, I added "handedness" to the category such that in each height group, we have three different bars showing the batting average for players using both hands, left hands, and right hands. To let readers spot the trends of different handedness more easily, I used three different colors to represent the three types of handedness. Surprisingly, there are no left handed players in the height groups of 65, 66, 78, and 80 inches, and there are no right handed players in the height group of 79 inches. The small jump in batting average at height of 79 inches is contributed by left handed players alone. Although the general batting average trends remain more or less the same, I noticed that left handed or both handed players have higher batting average than right handed. 

## Feedback
**Feedback 1**
It will be interesting to see the trends of the players in each height category further grouped by handedness.
