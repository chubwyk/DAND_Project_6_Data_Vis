# DAND_Project_6_Data_Vis
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 6 - Make Effective Data Visualization

## Summary
In this visualization, I would like to discover if there is any relationship between the height of baseball players and their batting average. The dataset contains 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.

## Design
In the beginning, I decided to use bar charts with "height (in inches)" on the x-axis and "batting average" on the y-axis. I used only one color for the bars because I would like to avoid distraction from the colors. The graph shows that the batting average peaks at height of 67 inches and then slowly decreases as the height increases, except that there is a small jumps at height of 79 inches.
